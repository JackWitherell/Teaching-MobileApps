# Post Mortem

In this project I learned several things
-what it takes to get started with developing an android app
-how to design an interface using the AXML format in a Mono subsystem
-how messy an activity can get when you start managing the functionality for each object
-different ways to mitigate typical issues (frame buffer oob display, button views not updating etc.)

I remember when I first started getting into the idea of app development and how the barrier to entry was very high. You essentially need to know a whole new language in order to start developing a UI, separate from the XML itself. You need to understand how different predefined objects interact with eachother, the order and each of the different attributes you can apply to them. I've always hated this approach to design since it gets harder every time you wish to implement something new that hasn't been accomodated for already. I always find it difficult to get this deep into a new kind of concept.

The more I worked with it on this project though, the more I realized that there's a reason for every piece of madness, and there's no precise way worth explaining it efficiently and promptly. You only need to dig in deep and figure out this new language that is there at your disposal in whatever way necessary to get your ideas in line.

I still have issues over the fine tuning components such as buttonWeight and Gravity, but I'm starting to understand their significance and how to properly utilize them. It's difficult but it's a valuable skill.

I'm glad with my results in this first project assignment and wish I could have found better ways to polish the program and shine it up even more.
