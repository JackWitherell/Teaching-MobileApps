# PROGRAMMING CALCULATOR
This application was designed to fill the gaping hole in my heart that would be filled by a decent programming calculator app for android phones. Works seamlessly in displaying hex and bin values of output alongside a base 10 decimal form. Input for binary and hexidecimal strings allowed. Instant conversions. Operators work under all three modes.

## System Design 
This can be used as a base for a more complex calculator app, short of adding features already implemented. Limited to 32 bit signed integers. No OCT mode.

## Usage
Open the application and gaze upon its majestic interface. Use like you would any calculator by typing in values, one by one, punctuated by operators and equal signs. All normal functions of a calculator exist as well as functionality regarding Hex and Bin conversions.
